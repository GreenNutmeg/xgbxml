How do I open a gbXML file?
===========================

A standard way to work with XML files with Python is to use the python library *lxml* https://lxml.de/.

In the *lxml* documentation, there is a section on `Using custom Element classes in lxml <https://lxml.de/element_classes.html>`_. 
This describes how the standard classes in lxml can be extended to include custom methods and properties.

*xgbxml* (this package) uses these custom element classes to provide a more user-friendly way of using *lxml* to work with gbXML files. 
By using the parser provided by *xgbxml*, a user gains access to additional methods and functions to read, edit and create gbXML files and elements.
